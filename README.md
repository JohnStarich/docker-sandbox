# Docker Sandbox
An easy to deploy sandbox environment for development and debugging.

This includes common build, editing, navigation, and runtime tools useful in my personal development.
Hopefully you find them useful, too!

A common way I run this container is as follows:
```
docker run --rm -it johnstarich/sandbox
```
